:::

## Generation 1

Server rendered web pages

- 1995 - PHP
- 2005 - Ruby on Rails

- server responsible for rendering every page
- tight coupling between the backend and ui
  - monolithic

- 2010 - Express.js

- 2010 - Backbone.js
- 2011 - AngularJS
- 2011 - Ember.js

::: notes
- web browsers became more powerful
  - we began to think about the browser as a platform itself
  - js became ubiquitous
- work from the server was offloaded to the client as a result
- server side dynamic was changing
  - microservices
  - ~2005 - Borg
  - 2010 - Mesos
  - 2012 - Eureka / Hystrix
- idea of a SPA was created as entire web apps could be created from a single
  page
  - client side routing
