\subsection{Motivation for this talk}

\begin{frame}{Why is the dev process important?}
  \begin{displayquote}[Anonymous][.]
    A good craftsman never blames his tools
  \end{displayquote}

  A corollary:

  \begin{displayquote}[][.]
    A good craftsman should know his tools
  \end{displayquote}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
  \item an old adage states that a good craftsman should never blame his tools
  \item therefore, a good craftsman should know his tools
  \item working on a tech project is more than just knowing a technology or a
    framework
  \item it involves knowing how to integrate your work with the ecosystem
    around it
  \item thus, you need to know your tools, their capabilities, and their
    limitations
}

\begin{frame}{Brief Overview}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Version Control
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Git
        \item best practices
      \end{itemize}
    \item Containerization
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Docker
        \item How to begin using it
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
  \item you have probably heard of these tools before
  \item if not, do not worry, that is what this talk is for
  \item we want to focus on best practices for using these tools and how you
    can incorporate them into your project
}

\section{Version Control}

\subsection{What is it}

\begin{frame}{Version Control}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item history for files
    \item no more saving multiple copies manually
    \item changes can be committed and tracked by the VCS
    \item modern VCS's can easily merge changesets (like you will need for your
      projects)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
  \item every project should be using version control
  \item aside from making collaboration easier, it allows you to view the
    history of your own changes
  \item helpful for identifying which changes introduced bugs
